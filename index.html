            My name is Nicolas Dragozov and I'm still a highschool student that is part of the middle college program
            and attend Canada Middle College. My home/current highschool is Carlmont. I've been coding since I was in
            middle school, starting with C# and eventually made it to learning Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
            I hope to go onto a 4-year college after I graduate highschool this year to pursue a degree in computer
            science.

        <p id="attending-reasons">
            I am attending this class because I want to major and pursue a degree in computer science.
            I believe taking this class is one of the cruicial steps in my journey toward becoming
            a software engineer.
